          I am currently a undergraduate student with a passion for

          With both of these passions, I gained experience being a{" "}
          <strong>UI/UX designer and web developer</strong>! I enjoy the process
          of mapping all of my designs and ideas onto various design interfaces
          and translating these designs into a website through code. The process
          of troubleshooting, adjusting, and implementing designs into scalable
          and usable applications is astounding to me.

          The biggest reason why I am pursing a career in tech is because of the
          evolving architecture. I love being able to constantly improve and
          evolve day by day. Thereâ€™s always so much do learn and do, with
          endless opportunities to grow!
